## Lessons Learned

This project was excellent for practicing modal implementation, and utilizing breakpoints that fit the design and provide the user with the best experience. Furthermore, I learned the importance of choosing the correct bundler for the appropriate project. I tried to use Webpack5 for this project but learned through trial and error that this was not the most efficient choice since I was not using a framework such as React to build this website.
